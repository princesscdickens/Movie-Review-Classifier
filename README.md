# Movie-Review-Sentiment-Analysis
Naive Bayes bag-of-words approach to classify movie reviews as positive or negative given the document.

The program takes two .txt files as input for training: neg.train and pos.train, which should be a collection of unstructured positive and negative movie reviews respectively. 

Later, you will need two separate directories for testing: 'test/neg/' and 'test/pos/' with separate test documents inside. I had 100 positive and 100 negative reviews.

When I trained this model on 1,000 positive and 1,000 negative reviews, overall accuracy was 83.5%

You will need Jupyter or MyBinder to open the notebook attached in this repository.
